# fermenter-controller
A simple Node.JS based system to control matt's fermenter project, based on a Particle Photon.

# to start
You will need to create a `private/` directory with a file `access_token.txt` in the main directory, simply putting in your access token to this file and nothing else.

run `npm install` and then `npm start` and that should be you good to go. If running locally then head to [http://localhost:9102](http://localhost:9102)
n a browser. Otherwise hit your server up on port 9102.
